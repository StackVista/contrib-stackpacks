# (not ${TARGET_BRANCH}'s tip) because if master moves forward after this
# branch was cut — e.g. someone else legitimately bumps a stackpack on master — the
# tip comparison would report our branch as "having changes" for stackpacks we
# never touched, then the version-bump check below would falsely demand a bump.
# Comparing to the merge-base reflects only what this branch introduced.
#
# Note: the VERSION comparison below intentionally still uses the tip — if we
# *did* modify the stackpack, we want to fail loudly if master has bumped past us
# in the meantime (concurrent bumps would otherwise silently downgrade on
# merge or force an awkward stackpack.yaml conflict).
